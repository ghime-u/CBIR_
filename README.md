# Content Based Image Retreival
The project involves implementation of image segmentation, tresholding and feature detection algorithms from scratch to classify images according to the raw 2-Dimensional Data. The Project involves creating different 2-D and 3-D histogram for baseline matching, texture matching, object detection, multiple-histogram matching, contrast matching, etc.


## Operating System and Code Editor
Windows 10
Visual Studio 2022
## Instructions
1) Clone the repository
2) Enter the directory path of your image database in the directory path
3) Run the CSVwrite file to classify the images in your custom database and write down the features in a custom CSV file
4) The custom CSV file will now serve the purpose of classifying images according to multiple histograms written in CSVread file
5) Run the CSVread file
6) Enter the number of matching images returned and press the following keys to select matching algorithms
7) Keys:
b - Baseline matching
h - histogram matching
s - spatial matching
t - texture matching
o - object detection

8) Any other key will terminate the program
